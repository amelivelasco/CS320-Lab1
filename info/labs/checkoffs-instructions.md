# Lab checkoffs

## Code preparation

1. Make sure you have a working version of your project, with the files for labs 1 to 4 included. **This project must compile and run**.
2. Make sure this project is open in an IDE and ready to run in a terminal.

## Logistics

1. Be prepared to answer questions about **all** the labs, independently of what you worked on while working on the labs.
2. Be sure to be there on time. If you are late, you will lose points.
