# Teamwork Statements

To monitor fair division of work in your groups, we ask that each of you submit, for each lab from Lab 2 onwards, on moodle, an _individual_ description with an estimate how much you and your team mates contributed in the project. Please use percentages rounded down, e.g., with a perfect split for Lab 2:

  * Person1: 33%
  * Person2 (me): 33%
  * Person3: 33%

The percentage numbers should add to 99 or 100; if you each repeated the same work, please renormalize and devide "redundantly" done work evenly.

After that, please add any specific clarifications and explanations _if_ you feel it is helpful, but try to keep them no longer than 10 sentences.

We leave it to each of you whether you discuss and reconcile these numbers and claims within the group. In any case, we would like to receive submissions from _individual_ students. In some cases we may see contradictory information if that reflects how people feel. If you have any issues or questions regarding this, please ask on Ed.

If we get nearly 33% from every group member of a 3-person group (with or without explanations), we will trust this group did a fair split and leave it at that. Otherwise, we may follow up with you. We will try to use this information in a positive way, and we hope that this step will not ruin any otherwise working group dynamics.
